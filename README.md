## Getting Started

First you need these pre-require :

- Node >=16
- npm >=8.0.0
- pnpm (Optional)
- yarn (Optional)

First, get packages :

```bash
npm i .
# or
pnpm i .
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/F](http://localhost:3000/api/F). This endpoint can be edited in `src/pages/api/F.js`.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
